## CSS Practises

This is a pug + scss playground for my personal scss practising purposes.

### Usage

 * `npm install` to install all packages
 * `npm start` to start a development server at `localhost:8080`, watching all scss and pug files
 * `npm run build` to create a production build
 * `npm run deploy` to deploy to `gh-pages`

### TODOs

 * Get live update to work
 * autogenerate a directory of all demos into the `index.pug`
