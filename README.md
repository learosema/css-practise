## Daily CSS experiments

This is a pug + scss playground for my personal scss practising purposes: https://terabaud.github.io/css-practise

### Usage

 * `npm install` to install all packages
 * `npm start` to start a development server at `localhost:8080`, watching all scss and pug files in the `src` folder
 * `npm run build` to create a production build to the `public` folder
 * `npm run deploy` to build it and deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch

### TODOs

 * Get live update to work
 * autogenerate a directory of all demos into the `index.pug`
